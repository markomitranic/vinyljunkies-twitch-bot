  # Match any .mdc files
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.mdc$"
  # Match files that look like Cursor rules

  # Match file creation events

    conditions:
      - pattern: "^(?!\\.\\/\\.cursor\\/rules\\/.*\\.mdc$)"

      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/my-rule.mdc
      my-rule.mdc
      .rules/my-rule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed Cursor rule file"

      For managing rules:
      
      1. cursorrules.mdc:
         - Contains core rules about rule file management
         - Cannot be edited after initial setup
         - DO NOT modify this file
      
      2. projectrules.mdc:
         - Use for all global project rules
         - Can be edited as needed
         - Should contain general development guidelines
      
      3. Other rule files:
         - Create new .mdc files for specific purposes
         - Place in .cursor/rules directory
         - Follow naming conventions

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Trying to edit cursorrules.mdc
      edit .cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc
      
      # Good: Adding global rules
      edit .cursor/rules/projectrules.mdc
      
      # Good: Creating specific rules
      create .cursor/rules/react-components.mdc
    output: "Following proper rule file management"
